I'm a math-comp-sci joint major, interested in data structure, computational linguistics and algebra. 
Here, I'll mostly upload any software/projects I end up making. Some of my hobbies include language learning,
film and literature, making music, writing poetry, and learning neat circussy things like magic tricks and riding 
the unicycle. I'm an avid learner and communicator, and eager to work both by myself and in teams. Have a nice day!
